Group Assignment  (group size: max 3)
Due: 27/Jan

1. (Ladder Climbing)  A monkey is asked to climb a ladder having 'n' steps.   Each time monkey can take either one step or two steps.  For example to climb  a ladder of 4 steps, the possibilities are (2,2) (1,1,1,1),(1,2,1),(2,1,1),(1,1,2).   Write a C++ program that prints all possible ways of climbing a ladder of 'n' steps for any given 'n'.   Also, print the count.  Must use class, objects, constructors.

Read IEEE coding style:  must use indentation, have meaningful names for variables instead of 'temp', 'dummy', etc.


2.  (Existential proof vs constructive argument - Ramsey's magic)  In any group of 7 people, there exists 3 mutual enemies or 3 mutual friends.  As a programmer, how do you verify this claim.  Exhibit c++ code respecting coding guidelines.

3.  (How large is very large - Golbach's Conjecture) Every even integer (n \geq 4) can be expressed as a sum of two primes.  What is the largest integer for which the conjecture is true.  As a programmer, how do you answer this question.   Exhibit c++ code respecting coding guidelines.
